1) HTTP :-

HyperText Transfer Protocol, it's not secured meaning the data is visible that's transferred over the server. HTTP uses port 80

2) HTTPS : 

HTTP with Security (SSL - Secure Sockets Layer/TLS - Transport Layer Security)
SSL is the older version and now it's outdated whereas TLS is the new version and is in use presently.  So TLS is the set of security protocols that are used by browsers to secure the data when shared over networks or from one website to another. 

Think of SSL/TLS as a wrapper that wraps your data before it's sent to traval across internet

HTTPS uses port 443

3) URI :-  

Uniform Resourse Identifier, is't the umbrella term, meaning both URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and URN (Uniform Resource Name) comes under URI

URL = where + how (gives the path/location of the resource and how to access it)
URN = what it is (just gives the unique name of the resource but not its location)

4) HTTP Headers :-  

HTTP Headers are the metadata that's sent with every HTTP request. HTTP headers don't contain the actual data that is being sent but it contains information about the data like

i) what type of data it is, ii) how to handle it iii) who's sending it etc

Types of headers -> i) request headers (headers/metadata coming from the client) ii) response headers (headers/metadata coming from the server) iii) representation headers (encoding/compression) iv) payload headers
